## Installing one package


* Install a new package or get the latest version from a repository

``` r
blaseRtemplates::install_one_package(package = "<package_name>", how = "new_or_update")
```

* Get a fresh link to the newest version available in the cache

``` r
blaseRtemplates::install_one_package(package = "<package_name>", how = "link_from_cache")
```

* Get a specific version from the cache

``` r
blaseRtemplates::install_one_package(package = "<package_name>", how = "link_from_cache", which_version = "1.0.0.")
```

* Versioned package installations are supported for cran only.  If unavailable, the latest version will be installed.

``` r
blaseRtemplates::install_one_package(package = "<cran_package_name>", how = "new_or_update", which_version = "1.0.0.")

```

You can find a human-readable table with all of the packages in the cache at BLASERTEMPLATES_CACHE_ROOT/package_catalog.tsv.

You can find a human-readable table with all of the packages used by a given project in the library_catalogs directory of the project.  There is at least one file in there.  For projects collaborating through git, there will be one for each user.  These files indicate all available and actively used packages in the R code.  This file is meant to be tracked by git and so can provide version control and reproducibility for the packages used in your project.

## Get a new project library

You can use this function to replace the entire project library with a new one.  By default, the function will install the newest version available. 

``` r
blaseRtemplates::get_new_library()
```

Say, however, that you are collaborating on this project.  Another person may be using a different set of packages.  This can in some circumstances change output.  To adopt the package library used by a different individual, supply their project library catalog as the argument to ```get_new_library()```.

``` r
blaseRtemplates::get_new_library("library_catalogs/<file>.tsv")
```

These files are created in a structured way; the files should always be named <user>_<project>.tsv.  Therefore they should never cause git conflicts.  You can use a simple anti_join to preview the differences between two project library catalogs.

``` r
my_lib <- readr::read_tsv("library_catalogs/<my_file>.tsv")
their_lib <- readr::read_tsv("library_catalogs/<their_file>.tsv")
dplyr::anti_join(my_lib, their_lib, by = c("name", "version")))
```
